# BedWetter
Water Alarm Clock

"The Bed Wetter" was an idea based off of a friend missing his Chemistry Exam. I thought, if only he had an alarm that actually woke him up in time for it. So I figured that if he had an alarm that woke him up physically then he would have woken up in time. 

In my opinion, water is one of the easiest ways to wake someone up, due to its variation in temperature from your current state and also the difference in its properties than a solid object. 

Thus, the idea for a water alarm was born and, in due time, "The Bed Wetter" was created. 

Using a timing mechanism and 3-D printed arms connected to servos in order to squeeze a bottle of water, water can be transferred from the bottle to the face of the user.
